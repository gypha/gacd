> ## Getting and Cleaning Data.

This is the course project, the purpose of which is, to collect, work with,
and clean a data set. Here we have three scripts:

1. CodeBook.md
2. run_analysis.R
3. tidy.txt

## CodeBook.md
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

## run_analysis.R
This is the R script that does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the data set activities.
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## tidy.txt
This is the result of the run_analysis.R exported and saved.
